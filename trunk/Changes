0.00_20  2003-04-10

- Docs for DateTime::SpanSet API 
  (not implemented)
- DateTime::Span API: 
  from_datetime_and_duration, from_datetimes


0.00_18  2003-03-25

- changes docs, changed API
  from_recurrence, from_datetimes, new()
- as_list
- previous() method (quite untested)
- small API changes
- revised docs, from Dave Rolsky
- small bugfix in creating open spans
- added DateTime::Span and DateTime::SpanSet
- put "..." to mark where we need more docs
- DateTime::Set and DateTime::Span API look ok.


0.00_13  2003-03-19

- added tests for set operations with recurrences/add
- iterator passes all tests
- the API is complete, as described in SYNOPSIS
- small fix in add() syntax; accepts a duration=> parameter
- iterator, next


0.00_10  2003-03-14

- union, intersection
- experimental code to generate recurrence from a simple callback


0.00_07  2003-02-28

- added experimental method create_recurrence()
- added experimental method add_duration()
- improved SYNOPSIS
- added 'immutability' tests
- new() will not try to clone non-DateTime parameters (such as the
  Infinity value)
- The program will die with an error message, 
  if one tries to use offset() or quantize() methods
  These methods might come back in a later version.
- new() clones its parameters.
  This means the parameters don't have to be immutable
- new() will give an error message if we try to use a scalar parameter
  instead of a DateTime
- Uses Set::Infinite as base class, instead of Date::Set::Timezone
  This means some methods just disappeared, like event() and exclude().
  RFC2445 support might come back in a later revision.
- Removed experimental Autoload code
- Added 'Changes' and 'README'
- moved POD to end of source file.
